I created a starbucks landing page using html,css,so far the webpage is static but im currently updating it to give it functionality.
What i learned was how to structure a html page contents,how to bootstrap layouts into my webpage.
I also adjusted the layout the layout for different screen sizes to simulate how it would look on a tablet.Finally,I enjoyed targeting each specific part of the page while manipulating and exploring the options of how I can style it.
